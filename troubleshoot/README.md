# yolov8lab Environment Troubleshooting

This directory outlines how to resolve issues with the **yolov8lab** environment, particularly when using **Spyder** and **LabelImg** together.

---

## Problem Description

When **LabelImg** is installed in the **yolov8lab** environment using **Conda**, **Spyder** may stop opening, and LabelImg might not launch either. However, uninstalling LabelImg restores Spyder's functionality.

---

## Solution 1: Install LabelImg with `pip`

The simplest solution is to use **pip** to install **LabelImg**, which seems to bypass the dependency conflicts that occur when using **Conda**.

### Steps:

1. First, activate the **yolov8lab** environment:

    ```bash
    conda activate yolov8lab
    ```

2. Install **LabelImg** using **pip**:

    ```bash
    pip install labelimg
    ```

This method should resolve the issue without interfering with Spyder.

## Solution 2: Uninstall and Reinstall Packages with Conda

If you prefer to manage packages with **Conda**, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling the necessary packages.

### Steps:

1. Uninstall both **Spyder** and **LabelImg**:

    ```bash
    conda uninstall spyder labelimg
    ```

2. Clean the environment:

    ```bash
    conda clean --all
    ```

3. Reinstall **Spyder**:

    ```bash
    conda install spyder
    ```

4. Then install **LabelImg** again:

    ```bash
    conda install labelimg
    ```

This approach may resolve dependency conflicts within Conda environments.
